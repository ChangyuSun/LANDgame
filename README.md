# LAND (a strategy game)
a easy and funny strategy game for programmer

So, if you wanna to advise or join me, please connect me by 1851323309@qq.com or changyusunme@gmail.com.

That's a game,but a serious game.Maybe it just fits the programmer who work under terminal. Maybe you'll find it like The Hearth Stone somewhere, but it doesn't. it'll give you an amazing feeling. You can change or fix it just for your taste. That will be a interesting thing.

History:Empty

now:Empry, I'm try my best to the V0.01 of the LAND

coming soon:V0.01 That a fully framework for the game. Have a try!
